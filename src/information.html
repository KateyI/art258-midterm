  <h2>Kawaii Kon</h2>
  <h3>What is Kawaii Kon?</h3>
  <p>
    Kawaii Kon is a 3-day convention that celebrates Japanese anime (cartoons), manga (comics), and all facets of Japanese culture. We offer a variety of events and activities throughout the weekend. From video games, table top games, costume contests, thousands of manga to read, a talent-filled Artist Alley, an expansive Dealer’s Room, formal ball, we have something for everyone!
  </p>
  <h3>Who Runs Kawaii Kon?</h3>
  <p>
    Kawaii Kon is operated by a core of directors from Hawaii in conjunction with a few mainland based directors. Kawaii Kon is a not-for-profit entity – that means no one makes a profit from the convention- Not the owners, organizers or staff. We do it for the love of anime and the local otaku community!
